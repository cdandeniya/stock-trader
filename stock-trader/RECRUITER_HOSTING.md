## 🎨 Make It Look Professional

### 1. Custom Domain (Highly Recommended)

Instead of: `https://stock-trader-abc123.railway.app`  
Use: `https://stocktrader.yourname.com`

**How to add:**
1. Buy domain: Namecheap, Google Domains, or Cloudflare ($10-15/year)
2. In hosting platform → Settings → Domains → Add custom domain
3. Update DNS records (platform will guide you)

**Looks way more professional!**

### 2. Clean README

Make sure your GitHub README:
- ✅ Has live demo link prominently displayed
- ✅ Shows screenshots
- ✅ Lists technologies used
- ✅ Explains what the app does

### 3. Professional URL Structure

**Good**: `https://stocktrader.yourname.com`  
**Okay**: `https://stock-trader.onrender.com`  
**Avoid**: `https://stock-trader-abc123-def456.up.railway.app` (too long)
